openmooc-engine

This is the core of the OpenMOOC platform, here you can create the courses,
the users, etc

To install it via the package repository you just need to do::

    # yum install openmooc-engine

If for some reason the package from the repository couldn't work, you still can
download the openmooc-engine RPM and try to install it with the command::

    # yum --nogpgcheck localinstall openmooc-engine-0.1_x86_64.rpm

OpenMOOC engine depends also on openmooc-tastypie. In case the it wasn't installed,
you should install it now.
